# Coworking Agreement

We have PST and MST member in this group. We will communicate via Slack when need to collaborate together.

## Accessibility Needs
Reliable Wi-Fi, flexible meeting times, quiet workspace, or extra time for reviewing code. We want to make sure everybody can access via liveshare on vscode. We can stop and try again.

## Collaboration vs. Individual Work Expectations
*Clarify your collaboration expectations - does your group want to write code together all of the time? Or divide work to do independently, then come together to share accomplishments? What tools and technologies can help your collaboration?*

-> Work during the class activity. Aftrer that, for work that can be done individually, we can work on individually. For any work we should do together, we can work together.
